# Bob Quick Reference Guide

A quick reference for common Bob operations and best practices.

## 🔧 Core Tools

### File Operations

#### read_file
Read one or more files, optionally with line ranges.

```xml
<read_file>
<args>
<file>
<path>src/app.py</path>
</file>
</args>
</read_file>
```

**Multiple files with line ranges:**
```xml
<read_file>
<args>
<file>
<path>src/app.py</path>
</file>
<file>
<path>src/utils.py</path>
<line_range>1-50</line_range>
<line_range>100-150</line_range>
</file>
</args>
</read_file>
```

**When to use:**
- Understanding code structure
- Before making changes
- Reviewing multiple related files
- Analyzing specific sections

---

#### list_files
List files and directories.

```xml
<list_files>
<path>src/</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</list_files>
```

**When to use:**
- Exploring project structure
- Finding files
- Understanding organization

---

#### search_files
Search for patterns using regex.

```xml
<search_files>
<path>src/</path>
<regex>TODO|FIXME</regex>
<file_pattern>*.py</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

**When to use:**
- Finding specific code patterns
- Locating function calls
- Discovering TODOs
- Finding all usages

---

### Code Editing

#### apply_diff
Make precise changes to files (PREFERRED for edits).

```xml
<apply_diff>
<path>src/utils.py</path>
<diff>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:10
-------
def old_function():
    return "old"
=======
def new_function():
    """Updated function with docs"""
    return "new"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</diff>
</apply_diff>
```

**When to use:**
- Targeted code changes
- Refactoring
- Bug fixes
- Most editing scenarios

---

#### write_to_file
Write complete file content (overwrites existing).

```xml
<write_to_file>
<path>config.json</path>
<content>
{
  "setting": "value"
}
 line 0 for appending

---

### Code Analysis

#### list_code_definition_names
List classes, functions, and other definitions.

```xml
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>src/</path>
</list_code_definition_names>
```

**When to use:**
- Understanding code structure
- Finding specific functions
- Exploring unfamiliar code

---

### Command Execution

#### execute_command

```xml
<execute_command>
<command>npm test</command>
</execute_command>
```

**When to use:**
- Running tests
- Building projects
- Installing dependencies
- Git operations

---

### Task Management

#### update_todo_list
Track multi-step tasks.

```xml
<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[x] Completed task
[-] In progress task
[ ] Pending task
</todos>
</update_todo_list>
```

**When to use:**
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Tracking progress
- Planning work

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### Prompting Tips

**Be Specific:**
❌ "Fix the bug"
✅ "Fix the null pointer exception in getUserData() on line 45 of src/user.py"

**Provide Context:**
❌ "Add a function"
✅ "Add a validateEmail() function to src/utils.py that checks email format using regex"

**Break Down Complex Tasks:**
❌ "Refactor the entire application"
✅ "Refactor the user authentication module: 1) Extract validation logic, 2) Add error handling, 3) Update tests"

**Use Examples:**
❌ "Make it better"
✅ "Refactor this function to use list comprehension like we do in other utility functions"

---

### Workflow Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Read → Understand → Modify
```
1. Read the file(s)
2. Ask Bob to explain if needed
3. Make targeted changes
4. Verify with tests
```

#### Pattern 2: Search → Read → Update All
```
1. Search for all usages
2. Read affected files
3. Update all occurrences
4. Run tests
```

#### Pattern 3: Plan → Execute → Verify
```
1. Create todo list
2. Execute step by step
3. Test after each step
4. Update todo list
```

### Tool Selection Guide

| Task | Recommended Tool | Alternative |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| View file content | `read_file` | - |
| Find files | `list_files` | `search_files` |
| Search code | `search_files` | `read_file` + manual search |
| Edit existing code | `apply_diff` | `write_to_file` (small files) |
| Create new file | `write_to_file` | - |
| Add new lines | `insert_content` | `apply_diff` |
| Run tests | `execute_command` | - |
| Track progress | `update_todo_list` | Manual notes |

## 🎯 Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Rename a Function

```
Step 1: Find all usages
"Search for all files that use the function getUserData"

Step 2: Read affected files
"Read these files: [list from search results]"

Step 3: Update all occurrences
"Rename getUserData to fetchUserProfile in all these files"

Step 4: Verify
"Run the test suite to verify everything works"
```

---

### Scenario: Add a New Feature

```
Step 1: Plan
"Create a todo list for adding email validation to the User model"

Step 2: Understand existing code
"Read src/models/user.py and show me the current validation logic"

Step 3: Implement
"Add email validation following the existing pattern"

Step 4: Test
"Create tests for email validation in tests/test_user.py"

Step 5: Document
"Update the User model docstring to document email validation"
```

---

### Scenario: Debug an Issue

```
Step 1: Reproduce
"Run the failing test: pytest tests/test_checkout.py::test_payment"

Step 2: Analyze
"Read the test file and the checkout module to understand the flow"

Step 3: Locate issue
"Search for error handling in the payment processing code"

Step 4: Fix
"Update the payment timeout handling in src/payment.py"

Step 5: Verify
"Run all payment-related tests to ensure the fix works"
```

---

### Scenario: Refactor Code

```
Step 1: Analyze
"Read src/services/report_generator.py and identify areas for improvement"

Step 2: Plan
"Create a refactoring plan focusing on readability and maintainability"

Step 3: Refactor incrementally
"Extract the data processing logic into separate functions"

Step 4: Test continuously
"Run tests after each refactoring step"

Step 5: Document
"Add docstrings to the new functions"
```

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### File Operations
- Read file: "Read src/app.py"
- List files: "List all Python files in src/"
- Search: "Search for TODO comments in the codebase"

### Code Changes
- Simple edit: "Change the timeout value to 30 in config.py"
- Add function: "Add a helper function to format dates in utils.py"
- Refactor: "Refactor the calculate_total function to be more readable"

### Testing
- Run tests: "Run the test suite"
- Run specific test: "Run tests for the user module"
- Check coverage: "Run tests with coverage report"

### Analysis
- Explain code: "Explain how the authentication flow works"
- Find usages: "Find all places where getUserData is called"
- Review: "Review this code for potential issues"

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Reading Before Editing
❌ "Update the config file"
✅ "Read config.json, then update the timeout value to 30"

### Mistake 2: Vague Requests
❌ "Fix the code"
✅ "Fix the IndexError on line 42 of src/parser.py by adding bounds checking"

### Mistake 3: Too Many Changes at Once
❌ "Refactor everything and add new features"
✅ "First refactor the user module, then we'll add the new features"

### Mistake 4: Not Verifying Changes
❌ Make changes and move on
✅ "Make the changes, then run tests to verify"

### Mistake 5: Insufficient Context
❌ "Add validation"
✅ "Add email validation to the User model following the same pattern as password validation"

---

## 📚 Advanced Tips

### Tip 1: Batch Related Changes
Instead of multiple requests, combine related changes:
```
"In src/user.py:
1. Add email field to User class
2. Add email validation method
3. Update __init__ to accept email
4. Update __str__ to include email"
```

### Tip 2: Use Line Ranges for Large Files
```
"Read src/app.py lines 1-50 for initialization and lines 200-250 for the main logic"
```

### Tip 3: Leverage Bob's Understanding
```
"Review the authentication flow and suggest improvements for security"
```

### Tip 4: Ask for Explanations
```
"Explain why this function might be causing performance issues"
```

### Tip 5: Get Multiple Options
```
"Show me three different ways to implement this feature, with pros and cons"
```
